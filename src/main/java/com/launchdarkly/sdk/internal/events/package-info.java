/**
 * This package contains the core implementation of analytics events and diagnostic events

 * All types in this package are for internal LaunchDarkly use only, and are subject to change.
 * They are not part of the public supported API of the SDKs, and they should not be referenced
 * by application code. They have public scope only because they need to be available to
 * LaunchDarkly SDK code in other packages.
